**Funny Mode:**  
> “Lunch is going well until disaster strikes: the office fridge has been hacked.  
> The hackers want TimTams, pizza, and maybe your Spotify playlist. Work together and save lunch!”

**Funny Mode:**  
> “The fridge saga ends here. You scored [X] points.  
> Did you save the snacks? Or did the hackers walk away with the TimTams?
